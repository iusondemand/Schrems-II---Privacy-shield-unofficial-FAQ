# Schrems II  
  
C-311/18 CJEU  
  
## The decision  
  
* Europeans can transfer eu datas to third countries based on SCC only if protection is effective  
* Scc are Standard Contract Clauses  
* Protection in US is not effective  
* Europeans muste terminate transferring of datas to US inf Europeans can't assure equal protection as with Euroepan suppliers  
  
## Effects  
  
* US becomes as UK after brexit: it must compliance to standard high criterias. Perhaps Us is not a safe place as Uk, with a different legislation.  
* There are not other legitimates simplified tools to transfer datas from EU to US.  
* There is not grace period  
* Now the decision about transferring EU datas in US is taken every time by each european, and must be documented  
  
## Can US entities   
  
help Europeans ?  
  
* No US entity can simply declare: "I comply to GDPR", they have to prove it (ex: cloud servers in EU and not submitted to US Cloud Act)  
* US entities can use other simplified tools ? No, US must in facts give equivalent protection as an European supplier.  
  
## Are there other options ?  
  
* Yes, but EU authorities must adopt only if there is  a public interest  
  
## What if ...  
  
* ... it happens a data breach on a US supplier: only the European  entity is fully liable if it not adopted measure (ex. Internale and european only cryptography on a US cloud service)  
  
## What must do Europeans ?  
  
* Check if contracts give effective protection  
* Implement other security tools indipendently from US suppliers  
* Fold documents on the US suppliers  
* Must inform data subjects and let limit processings.  
* List all suppliers by country, bases of processings, duration of processing, nature of processings, categories of datas.
